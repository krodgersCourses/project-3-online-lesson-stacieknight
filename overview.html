          Take a moment to reflect on the technology tools you currently use in your classroom. 
          Take a look at the list of tools provided in the resources section.
          Consider how these tools can be integrated into your lesson plans to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes.
          Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/#fullstandards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Idaho Content Standards</a>
           and find which standard you'd like to focus on. Write a lesson plan that incorporates at least one technology tool.
          Share your lesson plan with a peer for feedback.
